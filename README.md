# Indeed Hiring Lab Data Repository

The [Indeed Hiring Lab](http://hiringlab.org) is an international team of economists and researchers dedicated to delivering insights that help drive the global labor market conversation.

This GitHub repo is intended to serve as a space to host various regularly-updated data series to help economists, journalists, and other interested parties better understand the labor market conditions in their countries.

Indeed has websites in over 60 markets and 28 languages.  The full list of markets is here: https://www.indeed.com/worldwide.  We have economists in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, UK/Ireland, and the US. If you are interested in data about other markets, please contact us at hiringlabinfo@indeed.com.

The job postings data will be updated weekly, with the exact timing during the week depending upon Hiring Labâ€™s publication schedule. Our plan is to publish the trackers in all markets every other week, though that is subject to change.

## Job Postings
### Methodology

All data in this repository are the percentage change in seasonally-adjusted job postings since February 1, 2020, using a seven-day trailing average. February 1, 2020, is our pre-pandemic baseline. We seasonally adjust each series based on historical patterns in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Each series, including the national trend, occupational sectors, and sub-national geographies, is seasonally adjusted separately. We adopted this new methodology in January 2021. Historical numbers have been revised and may differ from originally reported values.

Indeed no longer allows Colorado jobs that ask the candidate to disclose their previous salaries. This has a meaningful effect on our postings in the state of Colorado and its metros, though not on our national totals. Due to this change, we are currently not sharing postings data for Colorado and Colorado metropolitan areas.

This blog post is based on publicly available information on the Indeed websites and is not a projection of future events, and includes both paid and unpaid job solicitations. US Armed Forces job postings are excluded for US postings.
