# Indeed Hiring Lab Data Repository
Note: As of 12/9/2022, Hiring Lab is re-releasing the Job Postings Tracker as the Indeed Job Postings Index.  The level is set to 100 on Feb 1, 2020. More detail is available here: [Introducing the Indeed Job Postings Index](https://www.hiringlab.org/2022/12/15/introducing-the-indeed-job-postings-index/) 

The [Indeed Hiring Lab](http://hiringlab.org) is an international team of economists and researchers dedicated to delivering insights that help drive the global labor market conversation.

This GitHub repo is intended to serve as a space to host various regularly-updated data series to help economists, journalists, and other interested parties better understand the labor market conditions in their countries.

Indeed has websites in over 60 markets and 28 languages.  The full list of markets is here: https://www.indeed.com/worldwide.  We have economists in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, UK/Ireland, and the US. If you are interested in data about other markets, please contact us at hiringlabinfo@indeed.com.

The occupational sectors in our data are an Indeed categorization based on normalized job titles. A list of those job sectors along with sample job titles is available in this repository.

The job postings data will be updated weekly, with the exact timing during the week depending upon Hiring Lab’s publication schedule. Our plan is to publish the trackers in all markets every other week, though that is subject to change.

## Job Postings
### Methodology

The data in this repository are the percentage change in seasonally-adjusted job postings since February 1, 2020, using a seven-day trailing average. February 1, 2020, is our pre-pandemic baseline. We seasonally adjust each series based on historical patterns in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Each series, including the national trend, occupational sectors, and sub-national geographies, is seasonally adjusted separately. We adopted this new methodology in January 2021. Historical numbers have been revised and may differ from originally reported values. Non-seasonally adjusted data is included for total postings.

The number of job postings on Indeed.com, whether related to paid or unpaid job solicitations, is not indicative of potential revenue or earnings of Indeed, which comprises a significant percentage of the HR Technology segment of its parent company, Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd. Job posting numbers are provided for information purposes only and should not be viewed as an indicator of performance of Indeed or Recruit. Please refer to the Recruit Holdings investor relations website and regulatory filings in Japan for more detailed information on revenue generation by Recruit’s HR Technology segment.
